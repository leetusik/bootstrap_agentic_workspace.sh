## Knowledge (phase explainers)

The `explain` skill ships with this workspace, in both `.claude/skills/` and
`.agents/skills/`. Explaining is an **operator-run step, separate from the phase review**:
run `/explain` for a phase when you want one and it saves an interactive HTML explainer to
the knowledge service. The review itself writes no explainer — it only reports the pointer
`explain: not written — run /explain for this phase`.

**Setup is on first use, and it asks first.** Run `/explain`; if no knowledge base is
configured it offers to create one on the hosted service at `https://knowledge.hi2vi.com`
— it asks for an email, installs the `knowledge` CLI, signs you up (or logs you in), and
writes an org-level key to `~/.config/knowledge-kb/config.json` at mode 0600. One org key
serves every repo. Each document's project defaults to the repo's directory name.

Already have a knowledge base — hosted or self-hosted? Skip the setup entirely by exporting
the credentials in `~/.zshenv` (sourced by every zsh invocation) — never a repo `.env`,
which neither Claude Code nor Codex auto-loads and which risks committing the secret:

    export KB_API_BASE_URL="https://knowledge.hi2vi.com"
    export KB_API_TOKEN="vk_..."

- **Codex caveat:** its `workspace-write` sandbox blocks outbound network by default, so
  both the setup and the save fail there. Opt in with
  `[sandbox_workspace_write] network_access = true` in `~/.codex/config.toml` — this
  loosens all Codex workspace-write runs (your call); Claude Code needs nothing.
- **Alternative (Claude Code plugin):** `/plugin marketplace add leetusik/knowledge` →
  `/plugin install knowledge@knowledge` → `/knowledge:setup`, then `/knowledge:explain`.
  A separate namespace from this workspace's `/explain`; you do not need both.

Drive knowledge through the skill/agents; REST is the substrate.
