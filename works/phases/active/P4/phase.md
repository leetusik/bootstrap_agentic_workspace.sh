# Phase P4: Model-flexible attribution, installer split, versioned workspace updates

_Intent: see [intent.md](intent.md)._

## Objective

Remove hardcoded model pins from executor defs and commit-attribution text, split the monolithic installer into installer/ with a build step that emits the single committed distributable, and add CHANGELOG.md + integer workspace versioning surfaced by /update-workspace

## Context

## Decomposition

Three middle slices, sequenced **split-first** so the attribution and versioning
work lands in the new modular installer source instead of the monolith. This
matches the operator-approved guidance in `plan.md` and the cross-job note in
`intent.md`; no deviation from the proposed breakdown was needed.

- **P4.S1 — Split installer into `installer/` with build + drift check**
  (`implementation`, risk `high`, order 2). Job 2. Dissolve the 3,025-line
  self-contained `bootstrap_agentic_workspace.sh` into an `installer/` source
  tree + a build step that emits the identical-behavior single-file
  distributable at repo root (committed). Source of truth = live repo files
  (`.claude/skills/*`, `.agents/skills/*`, `scripts/workflow.py`,
  `.claude/agents/*.md`, `.codex/agents/*.toml`, `works/templates/*`,
  `.claude/settings.json`, contract text), plus `installer/`-local payloads for
  fresh-install-only seeds (the 11 `DOC_BODIES`, the P1-seed text). Build must be
  deterministic (byte-stable across runs); a drift check fails when the committed
  artifact ≠ rebuilt-from-source. All three modes (fresh, `--into-existing`,
  `--update`) stay functionally unchanged — consumers still `curl … | sh` the raw
  root file. **Goes first** because it dissolves the heredocs that S2 and S3 must
  edit; doing it first means their edits touch modular files, not the monolith,
  eliminating the double-maintenance seen in commit `fde6f46`.

- **P4.S2 — Model-flexible attribution sweep** (`implementation`, risk `low`,
  order 3, depends on S1). Job 1. `model: opus` → `model: inherit` in
  `.claude/agents/slice-executor{,-high}.md`; de-hardcode `GPT-5.5` from the
  Commit Convention (`CLAUDE.md`/`AGENTS.md` line 96) and the explain skill
  (`.claude/skills/explain/SKILL.md`, `.agents/skills/explain/SKILL.md`) — model
  names become examples, the rule becomes "attribute to the model that actually
  did the work"; make "on `opus`" / "on `gpt-5.5`" prose model-neutral
  (`CLAUDE.md`/`AGENTS.md` ~16/19/61, `README.md` ~170/246/289). The Codex toml
  keeps its explicit `model = "gpt-5.5"` (intent scopes it out; Codex needs an
  explicit model). Rebuild the distributable via S1's build. Depends on S1 so the
  wording edits land in the modular source. Risk `low` → executor runs at effort
  `high`.

- **P4.S3 — CHANGELOG + integer workspace versioning in `/update-workspace`**
  (`implementation`, risk `medium`, order 4, depends on S1). Job 3. Seed a root
  `CHANGELOG.md` (v1 = this first versioned release; earlier history noted as
  pre-versioning). Add a `WORKSPACE_VERSION` integer constant in the installer
  source, stamped as `workspace_version` into `works/.workspace-version.json` by
  `write_version_marker()` (also update this repo's own marker). Extend the
  `/update-workspace` skill (both mirrors) to report "you're on vN → upstream vM"
  plus the CHANGELOG entries in between (read from the fresh upstream clone),
  alongside the existing `--dry-run` change-list; a missing local
  `workspace_version` is treated as pre-versioning. Depends on S1 so the version
  plumbing lives in the modular source.

- **P4.REVIEW** stays last (order 9999): validates all three slices together and
  consolidates the phase's durable-doc versions (see Doc impact below).

Risk tags are deliberate — they select executor effort (`low` → `high`, else
`xhigh`). S2 and S3 both depend on S1 but not on each other; `order` still runs
them S2 then S3.

## Findings & Notes

Durable research findings from the orchestrator (verified 2026-07-02). Each slice
appends its own cross-slice notes below when it finishes.

**Installer map** (`bootstrap_agentic_workspace.sh`, 3,025 lines): sh wrapper
1–99; python heredoc 100–3025. `COMMAND_SKILLS` 164–646 (15 skills;
`do-whole-phase` is `claude_only`); managed-files manifest 648–682; write engine +
retrofit/update policies 686–886; mode guards 890–972; `WORKFLOW_DOC` 974–1066
(emitted verbatim → `CLAUDE.md` + `AGENTS.md`); `DOC_BODIES` 1071–1512
(fresh-only); templates 1568–1631; P1 seed 1634–1721 (fresh-only); `WORKFLOW_PY`
1724–2663 (→ `scripts/workflow.py`); builders + emit 2667–2857 (`model: opus`
stamped at 2735; Codex toml `gpt-5.5` at 2852/2856); settings + codex config
2860–2903; finalizers 2905–3025 (`write_version_marker` 2909–2918 writes
`works/.workspace-version.json`: `upstream_url`, `synced_commit` [env
`SYNCED_COMMIT` or "bootstrap"], `synced_at`; nothing programmatic reads it today).

- **Payloads are byte-identical to live repo files** (sampled
  `.claude/agents/slice-executor.md`, `.claude/skills/do-next-slice/SKILL.md`) —
  the self-hosting repo is in sync, so building the distributable from live files
  is safe.
- **Repo-only files the installer never emits**: the installer itself,
  `README.md`, `LICENSE`, `.gitignore`, `tests/`.
- **Model-pin inventory (live repo)**: pins `.claude/agents/slice-executor.md:5`,
  `slice-executor-high.md:5` (`opus`), `.codex/agents/slice-executor{,-high}.toml:3`
  (`gpt-5.5`); trailers `CLAUDE.md:96`, `AGENTS.md:96`, explain `SKILL.md` in both
  mirrors; prose CLAUDE/AGENTS ~16/19/61, README ~170/246/289,
  `.codex/config.toml:8-9`. `tests/retrofit_smoke.sh` greps `effort:` lines, not
  `model:`, so S2's model change won't break it; effort or filename changes would.
- **`tests/retrofit_smoke.sh`** (164 lines, 6 blocks): retrofit
  non-destructiveness, idempotent re-run, foreign-workflow abort, docs-gating,
  fresh-install regression, live-vs-fresh drift diff. `--update` mode is currently
  untested. Uses `mktemp -d` + `trap cleanup EXIT`; requires git + python3.
- **`/update-workspace` mirrors** differ only in 2 frontmatter lines (the
  `.claude` copy has `allowed-tools` + `disable-model-invocation`); body identical.
  Preview = the installer's own `--update --dry-run` change-list; apply passes
  `SYNCED_COMMIT="$ref"`; it never auto-commits.
- No `CHANGELOG.md`, no version constant, and no build/packaging script exists
  anywhere in the repo today.

## Doc impact

Running list of durable-truth changes for the review slice to consolidate into new
doc versions (one version per affected doc, at `P4.REVIEW`, on a passing review).
S2/S3/REVIEW append here as they change durable truth.

- (S2, anticipated) `decisions`: v0013 "`opus` alias auto-tracks the top model"
  rationale is superseded by the Fable/Mythos tier above Opus — executor pins
  become `model: inherit`. Record at review.
