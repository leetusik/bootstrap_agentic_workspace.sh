## Objective

__OBJECTIVE__

## Slices

<!-- slices:begin -->
_Generated by `python3 scripts/workflow.py rebuild` from each slice's `slice.json`; never hand-edit this block._
<!-- slices:end -->

## Decisions

_Durable cross-slice decisions. Replace a superseded line; never stack versions._

## Doc impact

_One line per durable-truth change: `- <doc>.md: <what changed> (<slice>)`. Append only; the review verifies this list and a later docs phase consolidates it into versions — never per slice, never at the review — a branch review adds its two gate sections here tagged `(gate section — written at merge)`._

## Operator Questions

_Questions only the operator can answer. Append only; every entry is routed at the review — folded into the acceptance walkthrough or filed with `defer-job`. An unrouted entry is a review finding._

## Notes for later slices

_Gotchas and constraints the next slices need, each tagged `**(from <slice>, for <slice>)**`. A slice that consumes a note removes it; the detail stays in that slice's `result.md`._

## Now

_≤ 15 lines, rewritten by every slice at its end: what is done, what the next slice must know, what is open. Last on purpose._

# The design contract, schema 2 (workspace v60; v47 started the contract). A product repo keeps its
# visual design as plain files under DESIGN_ROOT_REL: a project manifest (design.json, which also
# records the product's Design System Artifact), and one JOB per `co-work` slice -- jobs/<NN-slug>/
# with job.json, the job's Design canvas as its publish root's project/ tree (canvas/project/:
# canvas.json plus one .dc.html per artboard), and the job's rounds (rounds/<NN-slug>/, each
# snapshotting the tree at close). The orchestrator publishes canvas/ to the job's own canvas Artifact
# as a plain copy; the engine only prints that plan (design-publish-plan) and never calls claude.ai.

# commands must move together. The commands are the only writers of the machine-readable parts

# and schema1/ (the v47 card record -- numbered cards/, tokens.css, rounds/; `design-migrate --to 2`
